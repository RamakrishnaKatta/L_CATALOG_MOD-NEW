        without bringing the furniture home. This could bring down the availability cost at
        the store, manufacturing cost of the larger units drastically increases the
        customer-vendor interaction in a much sophisticated way. Along with all these, think
        about the situation where the user takes the furniture home and feels the article doesn’t
        fit as he felt at the showroom and the customer thinks of returning the product,
        L-Catalogue will eradicate this problem and the huge transportation cost that
        is involved in this process."
